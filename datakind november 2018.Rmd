5-item self-report measure which provides an experiential impact of a disorder from the patient’s point of view. 
It looks at how the disorder impairs the patient’s ability to function day to day with depression and / or anxiety as well as phobic disorders.

Social phobia 0-8 

Agoraphobia 0-8 

Specific phobia 0-8 

COPD score 0-40 Assess severity of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) 

PHQ15 score 0-30 
-->5: mild
, >10: moderate
, >15: severe 
Assess severity of somatic symptoms 
Pain score 0-90 Assesses how pain has interfered with general life in the last 24 hrs. 

Diabetes distress score
0-102 Total score > 51 is a distress level worthy of clinical attention.


Does (soft) outcome depend on the service user’s background?

there are a lot of na's in some of the measures. might be worth not using all of them (not using last 4?)

first lets figure out if there is an improvement in self scoring
need to find max and min for each score for each user.
need to roll up by user and aggregate on max and min dates for each score

GINI: GINI importance measures the average gain of purity by splits of a given variable. If the variable is useful, it tends to split mixed labeled nodes into pure single class nodes. Splitting by a permuted variables tend neither to increase nor decrease node purities. Permuting a useful variable, tend to give relatively large decrease in mean gini-gain. GINI importance is closely related to the local decision function, that random forest uses to select the best available split.

For Mean Decrease in Accuracy:
Imagine you have a model built using a few variables including gender to predict if a person prefers coffee white or black.
Take one variable and scramble it in a way that matches the distribution of the variable (e.g. if the variable is gender and 60% of the observations are male, than randomly assign male to 60% of the set - preserve the distribution but scramble the observations).
Measure the predictive accuracy of the resulting tree.
Repeat for each variable.
The loss of accuracy is the Mean Decrease in Accuracy.
Note that this is not causal - and in practical use I would focus on the ranking of the variable as a data point for further investigation rather than the actual magnitude of the measure.


For Mean Decrease in Gini (Index):
Imagine you are looking at one of the nodes just above the leaves in a decision tree where you are predicting whether someone prefers white or black coffee.
At this node, the model has the chance to split by multiple variables.
It does this by searching for the variable to split where the split gives the lowest Gini index (lower is ‘purer’ / ‘better’).
If the model chooses to split by gender, the subsequent left node (e.g. male) observations may all like black coffee and the right node (e.g. female) may all like white coffee (i.e. both nodes are 100% ‘pure’ and hits the lowest Gini Index of 0).
If the model chooses another variable, the subsequent left and right nodes may have a mix of outcomes (i.e. be less pure, with a larger Gini index).
This is not optimal and finally the model chooses to go with gender

try binning the variables to improve performance

```{r}
library(woeBinning)
# Bin all variables of the data frame (apart from the target variable)
# with default parameter settings
binning <- woe.tree.binning(all_scores_users_1, all_scores_users_1$PHQ9_difference1, c('Age','Local_Authority','Gender','Ethnicity','Referred','Registered_Centre','Sexual_Orientation','Long_Term_Physical_Health_Condition_','British_Armed_Forces','Sum_of_hours_attended','Count_of_sessions_attended','Domestic_Abuse','Personal_Circumstances','Income','Unemployed_Since',
                                        'On_Benefits'))
